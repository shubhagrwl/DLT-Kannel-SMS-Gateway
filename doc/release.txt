Steps to follow when making a release of the gateway; if there is a
problem, fix it, and re-start from beginning:

	* Decide on the version number.

	* Prepare the software for release.
	
		* Make sure everything is committed to SVN trunk.
		
		* Make sure everything is working.

			* Run "make -s check"

			* Test with a real phone.
		
		* Make sure documentation is up to date.
		
		* Make sure NEWS is up to date.
	
	* Add an entry to ChangeLog that says you're making release
	  such and such.

    * Branch SVN trunk to branches/stable_X_Y_Z for packaging.
    
	* Update in branches/stable_X_Y_Z file VERSION to have the version 
	  number you want.

	* Bootstrap a checkout of branches/stable_X_Y_Z on dedicated distro.
	  Currently we're using Debian 8 (amd64).
	  
	* Add file compile, depcomp, ltmain.sh and missing.
	
	* Commit VERSION, and all modified/added files after bootstrapping.

	* Tag the release from branches/stable_X_Y_Z to tags/version_X_Y_Z.
	
	* Use tag/version_X_Y_Z is used for distribution tarball packaging.

	* Make distribution files.
	
		* Use "makedist" script, with the version number as
		  argument. Run it in an empty directory, not directly
		  from the SVN checkout directory.
	
	* Put new files on www.kannel.org, and otherwise update the
	  site to reflect the new release.

		* makedist output goes in ~kannel/public_html/download/$V,
	 	  where $V is the new version number.

        * Use the www.kannel.org SVN repository to change the html 
          files, and checkout in the corresponding htdocs directory
          after committing.

		* Announce new version on index.shtml, and describe it
		  on news.html.  Include an extract from the NEWS file.

		* Change the links in download.shtml, and update the
		  "Old versions" section.

		* Check changes locally before committing.  Note, this
		  will not work for the links on the download page.

	* Send out the announce to appropriate places.  Remember to
	  set Reply-To to the devel list.  Include an extract from the
	  NEWS file.
	
		* announce@kannel.org
		
		* linux-announce@news.ornl.gov  (not for all versions)
	
		* Freshmeat  (not for all versions)
