OVERVIEW
========

OpenSMPPBox is a special Kannel box that listens for smpp connections and accepts
and sends sms messages from and to smpp clients.

OpenSMPPBox behaves similar to other Kannel boxes and share a compatible
configuration file format and command line options.

After starting opensmppbox, a new connection to bearerbox is made for each
smpp client that is connecting. This (new) connection with it's own
'smsbox-id' is dedicated to sending and receiving messages for this particular
smpp client.

INSTALLATION
============
Please read the INSTALL file for further instructions. If in a hurry, the quick
explanation is:

./bootstrap
./configure
make

And finally, as root:

make install

You need to have a development version of Kannel installed in order to compile
opensmppbox.

The Userguide has also valuable information about the install and configuration
steps. To create the userguide, run ./configure with --enable-docs and then
type "make docs".
