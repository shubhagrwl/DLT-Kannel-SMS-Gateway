    Fixed crash when garbage was sent to the opensmppbox port.

    * doc/userguide.xml: move from DocBook V3.1 to V4.2 and fix various XML
      tag errors. No content change.
    * gw/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: automake generated files.
    * Makefile.am: add $(XML_DCL) reference to the xml.dcl file.
    * configure[.in]: we need the xml.dcl to be added to the jade execution
      to have a clean XML tag declaration, since we are in SGML mode here.

    Fixed memory leak, hopefully for good.
    Added fix for dlr_add to use extra parameter use_dst.

2013-11-12 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    Patch by Juno Lopez that allows for segmented reading of pdus
    when they are split over different tcp packets under high load.

2013-09-01 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    Fixed a small bug in the routing-upon-receiver number where opensmppbox would crash at boot-time
    if the particular config section is not defined.

2013-08-08 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    Patch provided by Alexander Kovalenko <alexander.kovalenko at ardas.dp.ua>. The generated smpp message id
    is now more than 8 characters in case of smpp version > 3.3.

2013-07-10 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    Patch provided by Kelvin Porter Kelvin.Porterat h3net.com. Allows routing to smsc based upon receiver number.

2012-12-18 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    Another patch by Victor Luchitz. Multi-part messages now have an smpp message-id of their own.
    This is in stead of the message id that first used to be the one of the first message-part.

2012-12-11 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
        Reverted back to v63 due to too many bugs and problems in these sources.
        At the same time, introducing a new ESME-to-MT routing possibility. See documentation about 'smsc-route'.
        Patch provided by Victor Luchitz.
        Users that currently rely on the MO-routing patch are encouraged to use bearerbox's 'smsbox-route'
        in combination with 'use-system-id-as-box-id'. It works exactly the same.
        The "old" opensmppbox is still availabe as a branch called "single-bearerbox-connection".
        You can still check that branch out if your software is relying on it.

2011-11-05 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    * gw/opensmppbox.c: Fixed memory leak concerning MO messages.
    Thanks to Victor Luchitz for reporting.

2011-05-13 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    * configure.in: the new configure file didn't seem to work, after make rpm.
    Couldn't find the Kannel libraries. This patch fixes that.

2011-05-09 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    * gw/opensmppbox.c: Default GSM character set is converted to UTF-8 (Kannel's internal
    way of exchanging messages). The facilitates foreign (e.g. greek) characters.
    Thanks to Nii Ako Ampa-Sowa (ampasowa at gmail.com) for the patch.

2011-04-07 Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    * gw/opensmppbox.c: Tested system_type on being provided by the smpp client,
    because if not, opensmppbox would crash. Thanks to info at xen-housing.sk for reporting.

2010-11-10 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/opensmppbox.c: applied patch that adds validity and deferred handling.
      Thanks to "XEN-Housing s.r.o." <info at xen-housing.sk> and me :-) for this patch.

2010-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/opensmppbox.c: remove 0-padding for %s type from snprintf(), as it
      is not defined according to the man page and we get compiler warnings.
      
2010-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/opensmppbox.c: remove various compiler warnings. NLC.
    
2010-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * autotools/*, gw/Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in: new 
      configure file after bootstrapping for distribution.
      
2010-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * */*: changing the add-on module name to OpenSMPPBox, along with all 
      references in the output and the configuration file aspects.

    Sending negative ack upon receiving invalid MO/DLR so messages won't stay in bearerbox store.
    Patch by Victor Luchitz.

2010/08/23
    1. Respects softfail from bearerbox (ack_failed_tmp).
    2. Propagates message priority in submit_sm further to bearerbox in Msg struct.
    Thanks to Victor Luchitz for reporting.

2010/08/22
    Fixed bug reported by boooch@gmail.com as where authentication including system_type would always fail.

2010/08/19
    1) add support for message_payload TLV for deliver_sm packets. This TLV is used in case a smpp meta-flag "use_message_payload" is set.
    2) brings smppbox in conformity with SMPP v3.4 in regarding shedule_delivery_time and validiy_period fields in deliver_sm packets.
    3) if connected ESME requests delivery report for a submit_sm packet, smppbox will now also notify the ESME of SMSC failures, generated by the bearerbox.
    4) provides documentation updates.
    5) some minor improvements, including larger dict-size for acks.


2010/08/16
    Fixed ghost connections bug, where disconnected smppusers kept
    being visible as connected in bearerbox status page.

2010/08/11
    Filled in msg->sms.sms_type that was incorrectly left undefined.
    Thanks to Tomasz Konopka for reporting.

2010/08/02
    Added optional support for PAM authentication. See userguide.
    Added recognition of bearerbox acks for messages. If for
    some reason the message is acked negatively, open smppbox
    returns an error to the ESME and vice versa.
    Also an ESME-timeout can now be configured in smppbox.conf.
    Changes made by Rene Kluwen rene.kluwen@chimit.nl.

2010/08/01
    Added extra actual parameter because the dlr_find prototype
    in the Kannel sources has been changed.
    The smpp username (system-id) is relayed to bearerbox as
    billing information (msg->sms.account). This can be used in
    order to bill the reflected user.
    A legacy sqlbox patch is available that uses this information
    for pre-paid billing purposes.

2010/07/28
    Patch by Victor Luchitz to add tlv's to delivery reports.
    At the same time fixed format of submit data/done date in dlrs.

2010/07/27
    1. Fixed esm_class for deliver_sm's.
    2. fixed original submit date in dlr's.

    Added support for per user-level ip-restrictions.

2010/06/16
    Added support for long messages being sent via de same SMSC (by re-assembling
    the message and sending it to bearerbox as a whole.
    Thanks to Tomasz Konopka for testing patiently.

2010/06/15
    Added HAVE_SHUTDOWN_CONNECTION #define, so we can use gwlib.a without
    patching.

2010/06/07
    First repository release of smppbox standalone.
    Some configuration options have been changed from the downloaded version:

    - bearerbox-port added which replaces the smsbox-port in group = core
    - bearerbox-host existed already but was not taken into account. It is now.
    - global-sender removed (was not used)
