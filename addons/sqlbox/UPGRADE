***** IMPORTANT NOTICE *****

If you're upgrading from a version BEFORE 2010-11-11 (0.7.x and
lower), please note that the format for the msgdata and udhdata
columns is now url-encoded. That probably means that if you use
inserts on send_sms to send MT, YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY YOUR
CODE TO URLENCODE THE MESSAGES FIRST.

***** OLDER COMMENTS *****

If you are upgrading from a previous sqlbox version before
2006-05-30, you will have to modify your existing sql table
structure by issuing the following command:

ALTER TABLE sent_sms MODIFY momt enum('MO','MT','DLR');
