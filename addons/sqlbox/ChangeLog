    - Initializing mysql port to 3306 if not set in config.
      Thanks to Vyronas Tsingaras <vtsingaras at amdtelecom.net> for the patch.

2014-04-29  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide.xml: move from DocBook V3.1 to V4.2 and fix various XML
      tag errors. No content change.
    * gw/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: automake generated files.
    * Makefile.am: add $(XML_DCL) reference to the xml.dcl file.
    * configure[.in]: we need the xml.dcl to be added to the jade execution
      to have a clean XML tag declaration, since we are in SGML mode here.

    Fixed a semantical error as where dlr's coming from smsbox were not saved
    in the log-table, even when save-dlr is true.

2013-08-11  Rene Kluwen <rene dot kluwen at chimit dot nl>
    Implemented configuration directives: limit-per-cycle (thanks to Alejandro
    Guerrieri for the original patch), save-dlr, save-mo, save-mt.
    Speed improvements for messages sent via the insert-table should be
    significant because we process batches of records both when selecting and
    inserting as well as deleting.
    Thanks to Rinor Hoxha for reviewing the patch.
    Besides, this patch allows for saving of the foreign id field in the
    sql log table (all database engines). This is backward incompatible.
    To continue a running installation perform:
    alter table [log-table|insert-table] add column (foreign_id VARCHAR(255) NULL);

2011-05-08  Rene Kluwen <rene dot kluwen at chimit dot nl>
    * gw/sqlbox.c
      fixed memory leak sending messages through the send_sms table

2011-03-09  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * gw/sqlbox_[mssql|mysql|oracle|pgsql|sdb|sqlite|sqlite3].h: Fixed
      segmentation fault when running on 64-bit environments. Thanks
      Andreas Fink for identifying the reason behind the problem.

2010-11-11  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKER: Extended Stipe's patch to url-encode the udhdata
      field as well, making it possible to send wap-push and other binary
      messages from sqlbox.

2010-11-11  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKER: Modified the format in which the msgdata field was
      stored on the database to be url-encoded. This avoids corrupting the data
      when saving it. Thanks Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org> for this patch.

2010-11-11  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dor org>
    * Fixes PostgreSQL code to properly evaluate null columns and avoid
      corrupting numeric fields on messages.

2010-11-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * acinclude.m4: use the gateway version to have the terminal sequences and
      various other m4 functions available.
    * configure[.in]: make the output looks like the gateway version, with 
      cleaner sections. Fixed cygwin platform builds.

2010-10-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * autotools/*, aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in: add autotool build by
      bootstrap run for distribution.
      
2010-10-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/sqlbox_[pgsql|sqlite3].c: more compiler warning fixes.
    
2010-10-06  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/sqlbox.c, gw/sqlbox_[pgsql|sqlite3].c: fixed various compiler warnings.

2010-09-11  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * Fixed bug: Not all sms messages were acked properly before, leaving
      messages in the message store. Thanks Rene Kluwen for this patch.

2010-06-16 - Rene Kluwen <rene.kluwen at chimit.nl>
    * Fixed bug that sqlbox didn't disconnect from bearerbox when one of the
      attached smsboxes would disconnect.

2010-08-02 - Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * Fixes bug that prevented single quotes to be used on message text and
      other fields. Thanks Rene Kluwen for this patch.

2009-12-28 - Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * Added support for meta-data on all DB engines
    * Added support for automake 1.11

2009-05-19 - Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * Added support for MS-SQL and Sybase

    * Fixed tab->spaces across all code

2008-11-21 - Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * Completed documentation on missing DB modules.
    * Added RPM support. Now it's possible to build RPM's natively by running
      "make rpm" instead of "make".
    * The module detects the DB engine compiled on Kannel and renames the RPM
      accordingly.

2008-11-18  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * REVISION 0.7.1 [CVS Tag: rev-0-7-1]
    * Added support for the LibSDB database abstraction library. DB support is
      now similar to Kannel's.
    * Extensive code reorganization to move the queries into the header files
      and allow reusing from the libsdb module.
    * Added examples for database connections on sample conf file.

2008-11-12  Alejandro Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * REVISION 0.7.0 [CVS Tag: rev-0-7-0]
    * Added support for Oracle, SQLite2 and SQLite 3.
    * Binary now install under sbin instead of bin, just like all the other
      Kannel "boxes".

2008-11-03  Alex Guerrieri <aguerrieri at kannel dot org>
    * REVISION 0.6.0 [CVS Tag: rev-0-6-0]

    * make patch failure fixed by Martin Conte

2006-05-30
    * Applied patch of Martin <reflejo at gmail dot com> for the bug:
      SQLbox is not reading smsbox-port. It is hardcoded to 13005.
    * Applied patch of Martin <reflejo at gmail dot com>:
      Delivery reports are now stored as 'DLR' in the MOMT database field.
      This makes it easier to filter them out if you are only interested in
      MO messages while reading the sent_sms table.
    * Bug fixed by Rene Kluwen <rene dot kluwen at chimit dot nl>:
      sqlbox now reads the port value from the mysql-connection group.

2005-11-01
    * Applied patch of Thomas Gottgens: The fields udhdata and msgdata are now
      created as blob and text fields.
    * Also some fields of Kannel.conf are renamed to match CVS HEAD revision of
      the gateway module.
    * mysql-username is now "username"
    * mysql-password is now "password"
    * mysql-host is now "host"

2005-09-29
    * First repository release of sqlbox.
