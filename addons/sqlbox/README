OVERVIEW
========

Sqlbox is a special Kannel box that sits between bearerbox and smsbox and uses
a database queue to store and forward messages.

Sqlbox behaves similar to other Kannel boxes and share a compatible
configuration file format and command line options.

It works between bearerbox and smsbox, intercept all messages and use a couple
of database tables to process messages.

Messages are queued on a configurable table (defaults to send_sms) and moved to
another table (defaults to sent_sms) afterwards.

You can also manually insert messages into the send_sms table and they will be
sent and moved to the sent_sms table as well. This allows for fast and easy
injection of large amounts of messages into kannel.

INSTALLATION
============
Please read the INSTALL file for further instructions. If in a hurry, the quick
explanation is:

./bootstrap
./configure
make

And finally, as root:

make install

You need to have a compiled version of Kannel available in order to compile
sqlbox.

The Userguide has also valuable information about the install and configuration
steps.
